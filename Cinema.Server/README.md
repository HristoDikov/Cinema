# Summary
Cinema is a web application where cinema owners can register their cinama and use the app functionalities. 
The user will be able to add the movies, the rooms and the projections that the cinema offers.
The web app provides buying or booking a ticket for a projecton.
If the user who booked the ticket does not come 15 mins before the projection the booking will be terminated and the ticket will be available again. 

# Using
The app works with Swagger, so you will know what data is needed for each request, however i will explain how it works.
You need to create a movie, a cinema, a room, a projection and then you can buy a ticket or reserve it and buy it with the reservation later.
I'm going to implement the front-end soon, so all these steps will be easier.
Keep in mind that you must buy the ticket with the reservation no later than 15 minutes before the
projection starts or the booking will expire.
